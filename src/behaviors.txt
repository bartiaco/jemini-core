Behaviors can't inherit from other behaviors (Drawable, Sprite, DrawableShape)
Behavior should provide an override ability for other behaviors (how else to handle draw, perhaps it needs to be smarter?)
Behaviors shouldn't use declared_methods. Instead they should use public methods.
Fix method collision (DrawableShape#set_shape, Physical#set_shape)
